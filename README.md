## Suspicious Extensions (Found from Research)

| Extension Name         | Reason It’s Suspicious                                                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PDF Converter Online   | Requests access to all websites; injects ads and tracks user activity            |
| Hola VPN               | Routes traffic through other users’ devices; logs data; known privacy issues     |

## Screenshots

- `before_removal.png` – No extensions installed (clean browser)

## Key Learnings

- Even popular-looking extensions can be malicious.
- Always review permissions, reviews, and the developer before installing anything.
- Extensions asking for access to all websites or browsing data should be treated with caution.
- Researching past malicious extensions helps build awareness of red flags.
